# Logistic Model for Titanic Kaggle Dataset
This is an ongoing project which I'm using to practice R and put statistical concepts into practice. It's intended as a <b>personal stats notebook</b>, the one I fall back upon whenever I need to revisit some concept or bit of R code. In time I wish to migrate all the notes I have on paper into this page.

The logistic model is there to give direction to the project, but in practice I'll be applying other statistical procedures even if they are tangential to that purpose.

<u>This document includes all the R code I use, the calculations required to manually obtain some statistical values, and the thought process I go through at every point.</u> It will undoubtedly contain errors.

The document is split into collapsible sections to ease navigation. I found this approach worked better vs using a table of contents, at least for the time being.

I have not added the Rmarkdown file to this repository, but all the R code is included in the actual rendered page. The html file is rendered with Knitr, I wouldn't recommend attempting to open it with a text editor.

I put the link in the About section, but it can also be accessed [Here](https://amsa3.github.io/amsatitanic/amsa_titanic.html).
